# Simple Shell in C
This project is designed for self-study and to enhance my proficiency in the C programming language.
I'm utilizing this README file to document everything I've learned throughout this project.
This encompasses
- ``C syntax``
- ``libraries``
- ``functions``
- ``and more.``

## Libraries that I used (updated: 9.9.23)
